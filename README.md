*  **Chart.yaml** describes the chart, as in itâ€™s name, description and version.
*  **Values.yaml** is stores variables for the template files templates directory. If you have more complex deployment needs, that falls outside the default templates capability, edit the files in this directory. They are normal Go templates, Hugo (https://gohugo.io) which btw powers this blog, have a nice Go template primer (https://gohugo.io/templates/go-templates/), if you need more information on how to work with Go templates.
*  **NOTES.txt** is used to give information after deployment to the user that deployed the chart. For example it might explain how to use the chart, or list default settings, etc. For this post I will keep the default message in it.
